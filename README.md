# Data Science Mini-Projects

This repository contains two mini-projects completed as part of my learning in data science and statistical modeling. Both projects focus on using real-world data to explore relationships, build predictive models, and create insightful visualizations using Python.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### 1. [Used Car Price Analysis](used-car-price-analysis/)
- Investigates how **mileage** and **transmission type** affect the price of used cars.
- Uses **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib** for visualizations.
- Applies **linear regression** to understand depreciation trends and model car prices.

### 2. [College Tuition Prediction](college-tuition-prediction/)
- Predicts **out-of-state tuition** for Midwestern colleges using attributes like **in-state tuition**, **state**, and **room and board costs**.
- Built with **multiple linear regression** and model evaluation using **RÂ² score**.
- Achieved **RÂ² = 0.83**, focusing on interpretability and learning-based modeling.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn, Statsmodels

## ðŸ“š Purpose
These projects were created to practice and solidify my understanding of:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Regression modeling
- Data visualization and interpretation

They were not intended to provide production-level solutions, but rather to demonstrate practical application of core data science techniques on real-world datasets.
